        Young Swiss businessman, Jean Henry Dunant was appalled by the condition of the wounded soldiers he happened to
        see in the battle field of Solferino , Italy in 1859 during the Franco – Austrian war. He arranged relief
        services with the help of the local community immediately. He wrote the book ‘Memory of Solferino’ suggesting
        that a neutral organization be established to aid the wounded soldiers in times of war. Just a year after the
        release of this book, an international conference was convened in Geneva to consider the suggestions of Henry
        Dunant and thus the Red Cross Movement was born. International Red Cross Movement was established by Geneva
        Convention of 1864. The name and the emblem of the movement are derived from the reversal of the Swiss national
        flag, to honor the country in which Red Cross was found.

        During the first world war in 1914, India had no organization for relief services to the affected soldiers,
        except a branch of the St. John Ambulance Association and by a Joint Committee of the British Red Cross. Later,
        a branch of the same Committee was started to undertake the much needed relief services in collaboration with
        the St. John Ambulance Association in aid of the soldiers as well as civilian sufferers of the horrors of that
        great war. A bill to constitute the Indian Red Cross Society, Independent of the British Red Cross, was
        introduced in the Indian Legislative Council on 3rd March 1920 by Sir Claude Hill, member of the Viceroy’s
        Executive Council who was also Chairman of the Joint war Committee in India . The Bill was passed on 17th March
        1920 and became Act XV of 1920 with the assent of the Governor General on the 20th March 1920 . On 7th June 1920
        , fifty members were formally nominated to constitute the Indian Red Cross Society and the first Managing Body
        was elected from among them with Sir Malcolm Hailey as Chairman. Indian Red Cross Society is a member of the
        International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. Relations between the IRCS and the India
        Delegation of the Federation are strong. Indian Red Cross Society has partnership with National Red Cross and
        Red Crescent Societies, St.John Ambulance, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement
        (IFRC), International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC ), Multinational firms. Individuals and others in
        supporting IRCS activities. It also coordinates with Indian Government and other agencies ( UNDP, WHO etc ).

        Red Cross on a white background, is the Emblem of Red Cross, recognized in 1864 as the distinctive sign for
        medical relief teams on the battle field. In the Russo-Turkish war the Ottoman empire used a Red Crescent in
        place of the Red Cross. Egypt too opted for the Red Crescent while Persia chose a Red Lion on a white
        background. These symbols were written and accepted into the 1929 Geneva Conventions. The IRCS adopted RED CROSS
        as its emblem. The National Society make use of the emblem as an indicative device in peacetime and during armed
        conflicts within the limits stipulated in national legislation, the regulations and its statutes only for
        activities consistent with the principles set out by International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent.
        During the General Assembly and the council of Delegates in November 2005 at Geneva, Red Crystal has been
        adopted as another emblem for the Red Cross Red Crescent movement.
